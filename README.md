# Malignant tumor cells are typically more active in terms of metabolism and signal transduction compared to immune and normal cells, and are associated with disease progression and deterioration in the patient. We propose a protocol for classifying cancer patients using TIME-ASP (Tumor immune microenvironment-Abnormal signal pathway). This protocol consists of step-by-step guidelines, including four key applications: TIME based evaluation, Tumor purity assessment, identification of abnormal signal transduction and metabolic pathways, screening hub genes.
